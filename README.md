# NBA-Comparify

Created an application that scrapes player career stats with Python and Beautiful Soup
Creates an API that is tested using POSTMAN and tested the API
Connected to frontend with Flask, Flask CORS, Flask Executor, and Axios

Set up accesses data quickly but may have inaccuracy with certain names --> Ex. Magic Johnson accesses the stats of Marques Johnson
