# NBA-Comparify

Created an application that scrapes player career stats with Python and Beautiful Soup
Creates an API that is tested using POSTMAN and tested the API
Connected to frontend with Flask, Flask CORS, Flask Executor, and Axios

Fixed Inaccuracies in data for common initial types by checking headers in recent commits

Improved so the application can now check current stats of active players or career stats of retired players in comparison
